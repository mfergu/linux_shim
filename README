compiling

	temp.c is the malloc being tested
	compile temp.c with "clang -g temp.c"
	compile the library and shim with the makefile
	run the test program with " ./leakcount ./a.out "

running in GDB

	gdb ./leakcount
	b main
	set environment LD_PRELOAD=./leakcount.so
	show environment
	set follow-fork-mode child
	r./a.out
